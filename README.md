# Jonathan Chang ePortfolio

This repository now contains a one-page GitHub Pages ePortfolio.

## Included

- `index.html` — main portfolio page
- `styles.css` — site styling
- `assets/Jonathan_Chang_Resume.pdf` — resume linked from the hero section
- 'https://Sminkid.github.io/ to access' this is where the site is at

## Run locally

Open `index.html` in your browser, or use VS Code Live Server.

## Publish on GitHub Pages

1. Push this repository to GitHub.
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**.
3. Under **Build and deployment**, set:
	- **Source**: Deploy from a branch
	- **Branch**: `main` (root)
4. Save and wait 1–2 minutes.
5. Your site will appear at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

## Next customization

- Replace contact placeholders in `index.html`.
- Add your real project details.
- Upload your reference design image to `assets/` and share it; I can then match this layout to that exact style.
